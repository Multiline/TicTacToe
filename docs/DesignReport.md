*SC-T-303-HUGB </br>
Late-term Assignment </br>
Fall semester 2017*


## Introduction
This document is the design report for the game Tic Tac Toe, made by students of Reykjavik University for the late-term assignment in Software Engineering (Hugbúnaðarfræði). The assignment will be coded in Java and completed using test driven development. 

## Game Description
Tic Tac Toe is played on a 3x3 grid by two players. Each player is assigned the mark 'x' or 'o'. The player with the mark 'x' goes first, followed by the player with the mark 'o'. The first player to fill a diagonal line, a row or a column with its mark, wins the game. If the board fills up before either player wins, a tie is declared.
