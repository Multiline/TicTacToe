## How to Install and Run
If you are using Linux/UNIX; bash or shell you need to insert <code>./ <code> in front of each command. In Windows you open the command prompt (cmd), and run the following commands:
  
- Open up the shell / command prompt and navigate using <code> cd [the location] </code> to the place where the TicTacToe repsoitory was located. The location could for example be <code>C:\TicTacToe\</code>
- Run the command: <code> gradlew build </code>. Using it, Gradle runs all the test cases and checks if the program is ready, in order to run it.
- Run the command: <code> gradlew run </code>. This command will run the TicTacToe game and a greeting will appear to welcome you in the console. From there you can put in your first mark in the game against your opponent.
