<h1>Administration Manual</h1><h2>How to Install and Run</h2><p>If you are using Linux/UNIX; Git Bash or Shell you need to insert <code>'./'</code> in front of each command. In Windows you open the command prompt (cmd) and run the following commands:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Open up the Shell/Command prompt and navigate using <code> cd [the location] </code> to the place where the TicTacToe repsoitory was put. The location could for example be <code> C:\TicTacToe\ </code></li>
  <li>Run the command: <code> gradlew build </code>. Then Gradle will run all the test cases and check if the program is ready; it informs you if there are any fails.</li>
  <li>Run the command: <code> gradlew run </code>. This command will run the TicTacToe game and a greeting will appear to welcome you in the console. From there you can put in your first mark in the game against your opponent.</li>
